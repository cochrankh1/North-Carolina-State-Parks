**Natural Wonder In North Carolina's State Parks** 

Growing up on the coast of North Carolina, I was fortunate enough to have endless access to outdoor recreation like boating, fishing, surfing, and wildlife viewing. Emerald Isle, the town I grew up in, is a bird sanctuary home to many species of waterfowl. Next to Emerald Isle, there is Hammocks Beach State Park that has a ferry system which takes you to a remote barrier island with no development which provides a glimpse into the raw nature of coastal wetlands. Fort Macon State Park further down the island in Atlantic Beach offers an amazing experience learning about the civil war. A little bit further is the Cape Lookout National Seashore which also has a ferry system that takes you to another remote barrier island with wild horses which have inhabited the islands for hundreds of years due to shipwrecks off the coast. Hence why the outer banks of North Carolina is coined the 'Graveyard of the Atlantic.'

These are a handful of places I was lucky enough to experience as I grew up in the area. They were so impactful on my life that it has led me to explore state parks all throughout North Carolina. This is the reason I chose this topic for my final web mapping project. OurState magazine wrote an article called the Natural Wonder In North Carolina's State Parks. It features 15 state parks, describing the impact on the author, and giving the reader a glimpse into these beautiful places. This interactive map aims to enhance the user experience by helping users explore and visualize the geographic locations featured in the story.

As you explore the map, hover over each pinned location to discover which parks were featured in the magazine article. As you move around the map, you'll notice a green boundary highlighting each state park. Zooming in further reveals the names of the parks, along with trails and other landmarks on the basemap. I sourced all of my data including the North Carolina state boundary and the state park boundary lines from arcgis.com, and I created pinned locations for the featured parks on geojson.io.

"From a 6,684-foot peak in the west to a shape-shifting sand dune in the east, our state parks hold the best of what North Carolina has to offer. Together, they tell the story of the place we call home." - Tom Earnhardt
